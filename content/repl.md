Lua intractive mode
===============

You can use Lua in an intractive mode. You just need call `lua` in your terminal without any arguments.

```
lua
```

You can exit from intractive mode by calling `os.exit()` function. Also you can use `ctrl+d` in unix like operation systems and `ctrl+z` in windows.

You can execute lua codes directly in commandline with `-e` flag.

```shell
lua -e "print('Moonlight')"
```
